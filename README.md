## 🚀 Key Deliverables & Analysis

### 1. Business Systems Landscape (AS-IS)
Ι designed the current **Business Systems Landscape**, integrating core enterprise systems to optimize back-office and front-office processes.
* **Core Systems:** ERP (Central), CRM (Customer Service), WMS (Warehouse), MRP (Production).
* **Integration Analysis:** Evaluated system interfaces and identified gaps in data exchange between Finance, HR, and Supply Chain modules.

### 2. Process Modeling (Data Flow Diagrams)
Developed detailed **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)** (Levels 0-2) to map critical business processes]:
* **Inventory Management:** Analyzed the "Product Receipt & Quality Control" process, mapping data flows between Warehouse Managers, Suppliers, and the ERP/WMS systems.
* **Customer Service:** Modeled the new "Customer Support" process flow, integrating Mobile App requests and automated responses.

### 3. Digital Transformation Strategy (TO-BE)
Proposed a strategic roadmap for **Digital Transformation**, introducing modern technologies hosted on **Cloud Architecture**:

| Technology | Application | Purpose | Hosting Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mobile App** | Customer Engagement | New sales channel & 24/7 support | Cloud (SaaS)  |
| **RPA** | Process Automation | Automating stock checks & order validation | Data Center  |
| **Location Analytics** | Business Intelligence | Optimization of new store locations | Cloud (SaaS)  |
| **Facility Mgmt** | IoT/Operations | Store maintenance monitoring | Cloud (SaaS)  |

### 4. Integration & Master Data
* Defined **Master Data** requirements (Products, Customers, Suppliers) for seamless consistency across applications.
* Designed the **TO-BE Architecture** to ensure full integration between the new Mobile App, RPA bots, and the legacy ERP system.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodologies
* **Methodologies:** Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM), Business Process Modeling.
