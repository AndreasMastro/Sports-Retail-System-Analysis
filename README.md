## 🚀 Key Deliverables & Analysis

### 1. Business Systems Landscape (AS-IS)
[cite_start]We designed the current **Business Systems Landscape**, integrating core enterprise systems to optimize back-office and front-office processes[cite: 37].
* [cite_start]**Core Systems:** ERP (Central), CRM (Customer Service), WMS (Warehouse), MRP (Production)[cite: 37].
* [cite_start]**Integration Analysis:** Evaluated system interfaces and identified gaps in data exchange between Finance, HR, and Supply Chain modules[cite: 39].

### 2. Process Modeling (Data Flow Diagrams)
[cite_start]Developed detailed **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)** (Levels 0-2) to map critical business processes[cite: 38]:
* [cite_start]**Inventory Management:** Analyzed the "Product Receipt & Quality Control" process, mapping data flows between Warehouse Managers, Suppliers, and the ERP/WMS systems[cite: 1618].
* [cite_start]**Customer Service:** Modeled the new "Customer Support" process flow, integrating Mobile App requests and automated responses[cite: 1807].

### 3. Digital Transformation Strategy (TO-BE)
[cite_start]Proposed a strategic roadmap for **Digital Transformation**, introducing modern technologies hosted on **Cloud Architecture**[cite: 40]:

| Technology | Application | Purpose | Hosting Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mobile App** | Customer Engagement | New sales channel & 24/7 support | [cite_start]Cloud (SaaS) [cite: 1965] |
| **RPA** | Process Automation | Automating stock checks & order validation | [cite_start]Data Center [cite: 1971] |
| **Location Analytics** | Business Intelligence | Optimization of new store locations | [cite_start]Cloud (SaaS) [cite: 1967] |
| **Facility Mgmt** | IoT/Operations | Store maintenance monitoring | [cite_start]Cloud (SaaS) [cite: 1969] |

### 4. Integration & Master Data
* [cite_start]Defined **Master Data** requirements (Products, Customers, Suppliers) for seamless consistency across applications[cite: 39].
* [cite_start]Designed the **TO-BE Architecture** to ensure full integration between the new Mobile App, RPA bots, and the legacy ERP system[cite: 1903].

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodologies
* **Methodologies:** Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM), Business Process Modeling.
* **Diagramming:** Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), System Landscape Mapping.
* **Systems Concepts:** ERP, CRM, WMS, SaaS, Cloud Computing.
